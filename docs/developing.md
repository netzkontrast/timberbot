## Building the mod

Requires .NET SDK 6+ and Timberborn installed.

```bash
cd timberbot/src
dotnet build
```

This compiles `Timberbot.dll` and auto-deploys to:

| Platform | Default `$(ModDir)` |
|----------|--------------------|
| Windows / macOS / native Linux | `~/Documents/Timberborn/Mods/Timberbot/` |
| Linux + Proton (auto-detected) | `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1062090/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Timberborn/Mods/Timberbot/` |

Game DLLs are referenced from:
```
C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Timberborn\Timberborn_Data\Managed
```

If your Steam install is elsewhere, override `GameManagedDir` when building instead of editing the project file:

```bash
dotnet build /p:GameManagedDir="D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Timberborn\Timberborn_Data\Managed"
dotnet build /p:ModDir="C:\Users\<you>\Documents\Timberborn\Mods\Timberbot"
```

On macOS, pass the platform-specific `GameManagedDir` and `ModDir` the same way.

For Linux/Proton setups with non-`steamuser` Wine usernames or custom prefixes, the bundled helper resolves the right ModDir via the same Python logic the CLI uses:

```bash
scripts/deploy.sh                # auto-detect (honors $TBOT_DOCUMENTS_DIR)
scripts/deploy.sh /custom/mods   # explicit override
```

## How the mod works

1. `TimberbotConfigurator` registers all services as singletons in the `Game` context via Bindito DI
2. On `Load()`, `TimberbotService` starts an `HttpListener` on port 8085 in a background thread and (when `wsEnabled`) a separate `TcpListener` on port 8086 for the WebSocket channel
3. GET requests are handled directly on the background listener thread (reads from `ReadV2` published snapshots)
4. POST requests are queued in a `ConcurrentQueue<PendingRequest>` and drained on the main thread
5. `UpdateSingleton()` runs every frame: drains POST queue, services pending fresh publishes
6. Game events (`[OnEvent]` handlers in `TimberbotEvents.cs`) and state mutations (`TimberbotAgentState.Changed`) fan out to the WS broadcaster, which pushes `event` / `state` frames to every connected client

For full architecture details see [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Settings model

The in-game `Settings` modal is the primary configuration surface for Timberbot. For the full key-by-key schema of every config file, see the [Configuration Reference](configuration.md).

All settings persist to `settings.json`, including:

- runtime settings: `httpPort`, `wsPort`, `wsEnabled`, `listenAddress`, `authToken`, `debugEndpointEnabled`, `maxBodyBytes`, `writeBudgetMs`
- widget UI settings such as `widgetLeft`, `widgetTop`, `actionLoggingEnabled` (per-backend model/effort/template now live in `~/.config/timberbot/config.toml`; the persisted `mode`/`goal` live in `state.json` alongside `settings.json` and are owned by `TimberbotAgentState`)

`TimberbotService` keeps an in-memory settings object and debounces writes back to disk. Editing `settings.json` directly is supported, but it is the manual/advanced path rather than the default workflow.

## Adding a new GET endpoint

1. Add a `Collect*` method to `TimberbotReadV2.cs`
2. Add the route to `RouteRequest()` in `TimberbotHttpServer.cs`
3. If you need new game services, inject them via the `TimberbotReadV2` constructor
4. Add a matching method to `TimberbotClient` in `python/src/timberbot/api/client.py`

## Adding a new POST endpoint

1. Add an action method to `TimberbotWrite.cs` or `TimberbotPlacement.cs`
2. Add the route to `RouteRequest()` in `TimberbotHttpServer.cs` (POST routes run on main thread)
3. If you need new game services, inject them via the constructor
4. Add a matching typed method to `TimberbotClient` in `python/src/timberbot/api/client.py` (the operationId in `openapi.yaml` and the method name must agree — the contract tests will catch drift)

## Adding new game DLL references

```xml
<Reference Include="Timberborn.NewSystem" Publicize="true">
  <Private>false</Private>
  <HintPath>$(GameManagedDir)\Timberborn.NewSystem.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
```

`Publicize="true"` makes internal types accessible. `<Private>false</Private>` prevents copying the DLL to output (the game already has it).

## CI artifacts (testing a PR locally)

Every PR that touches the relevant code paths uploads downloadable artifacts to its workflow runs. Open the PR's **Checks** tab → click the relevant workflow run → scroll to **Artifacts** at the bottom.

| Workflow | Artifact name | Contains | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python tests | `timberbot-py-<pr-number>` | Wheel + sdist for the proposed CLI | Any change under `python/` |
| docs | `docs-site-<pr-number>` | Fully-built MkDocs site (open `index.html` locally) | Any change under `docs/` or `mkdocs.yml` |

To test the proposed Python CLI from a PR:

```bash
# download `timberbot-py-<pr>.zip` from the PR's Checks tab, then:
unzip timberbot-py-<pr>.zip -d /tmp/tb
pipx install --force /tmp/tb/timberbot-*.whl
tbot --help
```

**C# mod DLL is not in CI.** The mod links against ~80 proprietary `Timberborn.*.dll` files from your Steam install, so GitHub Actions cannot produce a runnable `Timberbot.dll`. To test a proposed mod-side change locally, check out the PR branch and rebuild — the post-build target auto-deploys to your Timberborn Mods folder:

```bash
gh pr checkout <pr-number>          # or: git fetch origin pull/<pr>/head:pr-<pr> && git checkout pr-<pr>
cd timberbot/src
dotnet build                         # also auto-deploys to ~/Documents/Timberborn/Mods/Timberbot
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

Offline tests for the JSON serializer and pure helper functions. No game required.

```bash
dotnet test timberbot/test/
```

141 tests covering `TimberbotJw` (serialization, comma handling, nesting, reuse) and `TimberbotPure` (orientation parsing, name cleanup, assertion evaluation, value normalization, shell quoting).

### Test suite

The legacy `timberbot/script/test_*.py` harnesses have been migrated into the
pytest tree under `python/tests/`. Unit tests run without a game; the
`integration` marker covers the live-game smoke, validation, and performance
suites.

```bash
# unit tests only (default; no game required)
python -m pytest python/tests/

# integration tests against a running Timberborn + Timberbot mod
python -m pytest python/tests/integration/ -m integration

# specific integration subsets
python -m pytest python/tests/integration/ -m "integration and write"
python -m pytest python/tests/integration/ -m "integration and slow"
```

See `python/tests/integration/README.md` for the runner-level options
(group selection, performance budgets, benchmark iterations).

| Group | Tests | Description |
|---|---|---|
| read | 9 | GET endpoints, projections, map, schema, data accuracy |
| write | 16 | speed, pause, priority, workers, floodgate, recipes, etc. |
| placement | 6 | place/demolish, orientation, find, water, overridable, blockers |
| path | 16 | flat, 1z, 2z (all directions), A* diagonal/obstacle/no-route, sections |
| crops | 6 | crops, tree marking, planting, clear, demolish crop |
| buildings | 6 | detail, inventory, range, recipes, prefab costs, power |
| beavers | 10 | detail, needs, position, district, bots, carrying, durability |
| events | 1 | WS frame fan-out, `tbot listen` end-to-end |
| cli | 2 | CLI commands, error codes |
| perf | 4 | endpoint latency, building perf, brain perf, v2 parity |
| wipe | 1 | demolish all buildings + clear all crops |

### What the tests cover

- **Smoke**: representative coverage of the full `/api/*` read surface
- **Write-to-read**: POST change -> first GET sees it -> restore -> first GET sees restoration
- **Performance**: direct endpoint latency comparisons across the live snapshot path
- **Concurrency**: simultaneous requests against projection-backed endpoints
- **Validation**: `test_validation.py` covers 77 tests across 11 groups (read, write, placement, path, crops, buildings, beavers, events, cli, perf, wipe)
- **Cache invalidation**: place path -> count+1, demolish -> count back (EventBus + fresh-on-request snapshots)
- **Data accuracy**: `validate` endpoint compares cached vs live game state per field. `validate_all` checks all entities, all fields, 0 mismatches
- **Burst**: 7 sequential calls < 3s total (24ms measured)
- **Save-agnostic**: discovery phase detects faction, map bounds, existing buildings
- **Events (WebSocket)**: `tbot listen` connects to `ws://host:wsPort/api/ws`, receives `event` frames as in-game state changes

### In-game benchmark

`/api/benchmark` (POST, requires `debugEndpointEnabled: true` in settings.json) runs micro-benchmarks with GC0 tracking. It is queued and stepped under the main-thread write budget, so the request may take multiple frames to complete.

- Collection iteration patterns (foreach vs for-loop, enumerator boxing)
- Game API alloc checks (GetNeeds, Inventories, BreedingPod.Nutrients)
- Lightweight internal helpers like prefab collection

Results include per-test GC0 count, ms/call, and pass/fail. See [performance.md](performance.md#benchmarks) for recorded results.

## Release

This fork ships via GitHub releases only; the Steam Workshop entry "Timberbot API" belongs to the upstream [`abix-/TimberbornMods`](https://github.com/abix-/TimberbornMods) project. Users install the fork manually — see [Getting Started](getting-started.md#install-the-mod).

### GitHub release

```bash
python timberbot/script/release.py --release
```

This builds a Release DLL, packages a ZIP (`Timberbot.dll` + `manifest.json` + `thumbnail.png`), tags the version, and creates a GitHub release. The `tbot` CLI ships separately on PyPI as the `timberbot` package and is not bundled into the mod ZIP.

### The Wardens

The Wardens mod has no GitHub release of its own yet. After a local build (`dotnet build wardens/src/Wardens.csproj -c Release`, which needs the game's assemblies), `python wardens/tools/package.py` writes `dist/Wardens-v<version>.zip`: the mod folder, the map for `Documents/Timberborn/Maps`, and the install steps. `python wardens/tools/bump_version.py --minor` marks a milestone; `wardens/CHANGELOG.md` records it.
