# Timberbot API Reference

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base URL** | `http://127.0.0.1:8085` |
| **Content-Type** | `application/json` |
| **MCP** | `POST /mcp` hosts a stateless MCP 2026-07-28 server on the same port; see [MCP Endpoint](mcp.md). |
| **Authentication** | Opt-in. None by default; when `authToken` is set in `settings.json` (or `TBOT_AUTH_TOKEN` env / `[client].auth_token` in `~/.config/timberbot/config.toml` on the client side), every `/api/*` route except `/api/ping` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Missing or wrong tokens get `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="timberbot"`. |
| **CORS** | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` |

### Output Format

All endpoints support two output formats via `?format=` query param or `"format"` in POST body.

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `toon` | Default. Compact CSV tables via [TOON format](https://github.com/toon-format/toon). Requires `pip install toons` |
| `json` | Full nested data for programmatic access |

**Uniform schema:** every object in an array has identical keys in both formats. Missing values get defaults (`""`, `0`). **Booleans are 0/1 integers**, not true/false.

### Error Format

All errors return JSON with an `error` field in `"code: detail"` format. Every error is designed to be actionable: it tells you what went wrong, echoes what you sent, and tells you what to do next.

```json
{"error": "not_found: no entity with this id", "id": -12345}
{"error": "invalid_type: not a floodgate. use buildings name:Floodgate to find floodgates", "id": -12345, "name": "LumberjackFlag"}
{"error": "invalid_param: speed must be 0-3 (0=pause, 1=normal, 2=fast, 3=fastest)", "got": 5}
{"error": "insufficient_science: not enough science points to unlock", "building": "LargePowerWheel", "scienceCost": 60, "currentPoints": 10}
{"error": "not_found: source district does not exist", "from": "Bad Name", "districts": ["District 1", "District 2"]}
{"error": "not_found: recipe does not exist for this building", "recipeId": "Bad", "available": ["PlankRecipe", "TreatedPlankRecipe"]}
```

The error string starts with a machine-readable code. Parse the prefix before `:` to switch on it. Everything after `:` is human context.

| Code prefix | Meaning | Extra fields |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `not_found` | Entity, building, or district does not exist | `id`, `districts`, `available`, `building` |
| `invalid_prefab` | Prefab name does not exist. Suggests similar names | `prefab` |
| `invalid_type` | Entity exists but wrong type for this operation | `id`, `name` |
| `invalid_param` | Parameter value out of range or invalid | `got` |
| `not_unlocked` | Building requires science unlock first | `prefab`, `scienceCost`, `currentPoints` |
| `insufficient_science` | Not enough science points | `building`, `scienceCost`, `currentPoints` |
| `no_population` | No beavers available to migrate | `from`, `available`, `requested` |
| `disabled` | Feature disabled in settings.json | |
| `unknown_endpoint` | Route not found | `get_endpoints`, `post_endpoints` |
| `invalid_body` | Malformed JSON request body | |
| `operation_failed` | Game service threw an exception | varies |
| `internal_error` | Unhandled server error | |

### Python CLI

All HTTP endpoints are accessible via the Python client:

```bash
tbot <command>                                # TOON format
tbot --json <command>                         # JSON format
tbot <command> <pos1> <pos2> --flag=value     # python-fire: positional and/or flag args
tbot --host=192.168.1.50 --port=8085 summary  # remote connection
```

Run `tbot <command> --help` to see the typed positional/flag signature for any command. Hyphens and underscores in flag names are interchangeable (`--source-id=42` ≡ `--source_id=42`).

The in-game Timberbot widget is the primary way to launch and configure the built-in agent. The Python CLI remains available for direct API access and advanced workflows.

### Pagination

List endpoints (buildings, beavers, trees, crops, gatherables, alerts, notifications) support server-side pagination via query params:

| Param | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | 100 | Max items to return. `0` = unlimited (all items) |
| `offset` | 0 | Skip first N items |

When `limit > 0`, response wraps in a metadata object:

```json
{"total": 200, "offset": 50, "limit": 10, "items": [...]}
```

When `limit=0`, returns a flat array (backward compatible):

```json
[{...}, {...}, ...]
```

The Python CLI passes `limit=0` by default (AI/scripts typically want all data).

### Server-side Filtering

List endpoints also support server-side filtering via query params (also available as CLI params):

| Param | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Case-insensitive substring match on entity name |
| x | X coordinate for proximity filter (requires y) |
| y | Y coordinate for proximity filter (requires x) |
| radius | Manhattan distance radius (requires x and y). Default: 30 |

Filters apply BEFORE pagination. The `total` in paginated responses reflects filtered count.

```
GET /api/buildings?name=Farm                    # all FarmHouses
GET /api/buildings?x=120&y=140&radius=20        # buildings near (120,140)
GET /api/trees?name=Pine&limit=10               # first 10 pine trees
GET /api/beavers?name=Bot&limit=0               # all bots (unlimited)
```

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
tbot buildings --name=Farm                          # all FarmHouses
tbot buildings --x=120 --y=140 --radius=20          # buildings near (120,140)
tbot trees --name=Pine --limit=10                   # first 10 pine trees
tbot beavers --name=Bot                             # all bots (unlimited)
```

## Agent

The mod no longer spawns the agent. The in-game widget owns mode + goal +
ready, and an out-of-process connector (`tbot watch`) reads / writes that
state over the WebSocket and dispatches agent runs. The HTTP endpoints below
exist for the widget itself and for HTTP-only clients; the same fields are
pushed live as a `state` frame on the WebSocket (see
[websocket-protocol.md](websocket-protocol.md)).

All four routes are **gate-exempt** — they keep working when `ready=false`.

### GET /api/agent/state

Full widget/connector state snapshot. The push-style equivalent is the WS
`state` frame; polling this endpoint is the slow-path fallback for HTTP-only
clients.

#### Response

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| mode | string | `autonomous` or `request`. Default `request`. |
| goal | string | Free-form objective text persisted across sessions. |
| ready | boolean | Ready gate. `false` until the player presses Launch in the widget. Not persisted — resets on every save load. |
| pendingRequest | object \| null | Single-slot prompt waiting to be picked up by the connector. `{id, prompt}` or `null` if the slot is empty. |
| agentStatus | string | Connector-reported status string (free-form, e.g. `"idle"`, `"running"`). |
| lastError | string \| null | Most recent fatal error reported by the connector. `null` if no error has been reported in this session. |

```json
{
  "mode": "autonomous",
  "goal": "reach 50 beavers with 77 wellbeing",
  "ready": true,
  "pendingRequest": null,
  "agentStatus": "idle",
  "lastError": null
}
```

### POST /api/agent/config

Update persisted agent configuration (mode and/or goal). Either or both
fields may be omitted to leave the corresponding value untouched. Triggers
a `state` frame on the WebSocket.

#### Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| mode | string | no | `autonomous` or `request`. |
| goal | string | no | New goal text. |

```json
{"mode": "autonomous", "goal": "reach 50 beavers with 77 wellbeing"}
```

#### Response

The full `AgentState` (same shape as `GET /api/agent/state`).

Possible errors:
- `invalid_mode: must be 'autonomous' or 'request'`

### POST /api/agent/request

Submit a new prompt to the single pending-request slot. The connected
`tbot watch` clients see the new `pendingRequest` immediately via a `state`
frame on the WebSocket. The widget's Launch button uses this endpoint when
`mode=request`.

#### Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| prompt | string | yes | Non-empty prompt text. |

```json
{"prompt": "place 3 farms near the river"}
```

#### Response

```json
{"pendingRequest": {"id": 17, "prompt": "place 3 farms near the river"}}
```

`id` is a monotonic request identifier. Connectors ack with
`acked_request_id >= id` in their next `heartbeat` frame to clear the slot.

Possible errors:
- `invalid_prompt: prompt is required` if `prompt` is missing or empty

### POST /api/ready

Toggle the ready gate (Launch / Stop). `ready=false` causes every
non-whitelisted `/api/*` route (reads AND writes) to return `409 game_not_ready`
until the player re-Launches. `ready` is intentionally not persisted —
the gate is closed on every game load. The WebSocket channel on port 8086
is **not** gated; clients stay connected across Launch / Stop toggles.

#### Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| ready | boolean | yes | New ready state. |

```json
{"ready": true}
```

#### Response

```json
{"ready": true}
```

Possible errors:
- `invalid_ready: 'ready' boolean is required`

| temperateWeatherDuration | int | Days of temperate weather this cycle |
| hazardousWeatherDuration | int | Days of hazardous weather this cycle |
| cycleLengthInDays | int | Total cycle length |

```json
{
  "cycle": 3,
  "cycleDay": 5,
  "isHazardous": false,
  "temperateWeatherDuration": 12,
  "hazardousWeatherDuration": 6,
  "cycleLengthInDays": 18
}
```

---

### GET /api/power

Power networks. Groups all powered buildings by their connected network. Buildings sharing a power network have the same supply and demand values.

**CLI:** `tbot power`

#### Response

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | int | Network identity hash |
| supply | float | Current power supply (from generators with workers) |
| demand | float | Total power demand from consumers |
| buildings | array | Buildings on this network |
| buildings[].name | string | Building name |
| buildings[].id | int | Instance ID |
| buildings[].isGenerator | bool | Power source (wheel, engine) |
| buildings[].nominalOutput | float | Max power output capacity |
| buildings[].nominalInput | float | Power draw when running |

Networks with `supply < demand` are underpowered — powered buildings run intermittently. Isolated buildings (no power chain) appear as single-building networks with `supply: 0`.

## Events (WebSocket)

Game events ship as server-push frames on the mod's WebSocket channel rather than HTTP webhooks. Connect to `ws://<host>:<wsPort>/api/ws` (default `ws://127.0.0.1:8086/api/ws`) and filter inbound frames for `type == "event"`:

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "payload": {
    "event": "drought.start",
    "day": 45,
    "timestamp": 1711300000,
    "data": {"duration": 8}
  }
}
```

- Frame envelope, auth (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `?token=…`), reconnect semantics, and the full message-type catalog are in [websocket-protocol.md](websocket-protocol.md).
- The event catalog (68 events) and consumer examples (`tbot listen`, custom WS clients) are in [events.md](events.md).
- The pre-v0.9 outbound HTTP webhook endpoints (`POST /api/webhooks`, `GET /api/webhooks`, `POST /api/webhooks/delete`) and the `webhooksEnabled` / `webhookBatchMs` / `webhookCircuitBreaker` / `webhookMaxPendingEvents` / `webhookValidateUrls` settings have been removed. Old `settings.json` files emit a one-line deprecation warning at load.

---

## Debug

    "debug target:call path:_navMeshService method:AreConnectedRoadInstant arg0:120,142,2 arg1:130,142,2"
  ]
}
```

#### Path syntax

- Dot-separated: `_fieldName.PropertyName.NestedField`
- List indexing: `_entityRegistry.Entities.[0]`
- GetComponent: `~TypeName` (e.g. `~MechanicalNode`)
- Chain from last result: `$.PropertyName`

!!! warning "Debug only"
    This endpoint uses reflection on game internals. It may break on Timberborn updates. Not intended for production automation.

---

### POST /api/benchmark

Profile internal hot paths and server micro-benchmarks. Requires `debugEndpointEnabled: true` in settings.json.

**CLI:** `tbot benchmark --iterations=100`

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| iterations | int | no | Number of measured iterations per benchmark case (default 100) |

#### Response

Returns per-case timing and GC allocation counts for internal micro-benchmarks. Benchmark work is queued and advanced incrementally across frames so the request may take longer wall-clock time without monopolizing one frame.

!!! warning "Debug only"
    Requires `debugEndpointEnabled: true`. Returns `{"error": "disabled: benchmark endpoint"}` when disabled.

### find (CLI-only)

Find entities by name and/or proximity.

```bash
tbot find --source=buildings --name=Pump --x=120 --y=130 --radius=20
```

### place_path (CLI-only)

A* path routing with auto-stairs/platforms. Wraps `POST /api/path/place`.

```bash
tbot place_path --x1=120 --y1=130 --x2=150 --y2=160
tbot place_path --x1=0 --y1=0 --x2=255 --y2=255 --style=straight
tbot place_path --x1=120 --y1=130 --x2=150 --y2=160 --sections=1 --timings=true
```

### launch (CLI-only)

Start Timberborn with `--tb-settlement` / `--tb-save` Steam launch args; the mod's `TimberbotAutoLoad` picks them up at the main menu and loads the save.

- On Windows/Linux, this also starts Steam (`-applaunch 1062090 …`).
- On macOS, prints a copy-pasteable Steam launch-options string; the user opens the game manually.
- Does not read or write any file under the game's Documents/Mods tree.

```bash
tbot launch --settlement=Potato --save=Tomato
```

### top (CLI-only)

Live colony dashboard. Population, resources, weather, drought countdown, wellbeing breakdown, alerts.

```bash
tbot top
```

### Spatial memory (CLI-focused)

Persistent colony knowledge under the OS user-data dir (`~/.local/share/timberbot/memory/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/timberbot/memory/` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\timberbot\memory\` on Windows). Override with `TBOT_DATA_DIR`. Older `brain.toon` files under the legacy `Documents/Timberborn/Mods/Timberbot/memory/` tree are migrated on first run.

```bash
tbot brain                                                      # live summary + persistent goal/tasks/locations
tbot brain --goal="get to 77 wellbeing"                        # set persistent goal
tbot set_location --name=berries --x=120 --y=140 --note="south of DC"  # save a named location
tbot remove_location --name=berries                             # remove a saved location
tbot list_locations                                             # list saved locations
tbot add_task --action="build roads"                            # add task to work queue
tbot update_task --id=1 --status=done                           # update task status
tbot list_tasks                                                 # show all tasks
tbot clear_tasks                                                # remove done tasks
```

`brain` returns live summary (always fresh from `/api/summary`) plus persistent state from `<user-data>/timberbot/memory/<settlement>/brain.toon` (goal, tasks, locations). Summary is never persisted. only goal, tasks, and locations survive between sessions. Set a persistent goal with `brain --goal="text"`. The built-in in-game agent also uses `brain` internally during startup before it launches Claude/Codex.

---

## Reference

### IDs and Names

- **Building IDs** are deterministic 32-bit hashes of internal game GUIDs. They are persistent and will survive game restarts and colony reloads.
- **Prefab names** come from `GET /api/prefabs`. Include faction suffix (e.g. `"LumberjackFlag.IronTeeth"`).
- **Good names** match Timberborn internal names: `Water`, `Log`, `Plank`, `Berries`, `Bread`, etc.
- **Building names** in responses are cleaned: `(Clone)`, `.IronTeeth`, `.Folktails` suffixes removed.

### Priority Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `VeryLow` | Lowest priority |
| `Normal` | Default |
| `VeryHigh` | Highest priority |

Two priority types exist per building: `construction` (while building) and `workplace` (when finished). Set both on new buildings.

### Orientation

| Value | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | south | Default facing |
| 1 | west | 90 degrees clockwise |
| 2 | north | 180 degrees |
| 3 | east | 270 degrees clockwise |

Coordinates always refer to the bottom-left corner of the footprint regardless of orientation. Python CLI accepts names (`south`, `west`, `north`, `east` or `s`/`w`/`n`/`e`).

### Crop Names

`Kohlrabi`, `Cassava`, `Carrot`, `Potato`, `Wheat`, `Sunflower`, `Corn`, `Eggplant`, `Soybean`

### Import Options

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | No importing |
| `Allowed` | Import when needed |
| `Forced` | Always import |

## Known Issues

!!! bug "Ghost Buildings"
    `POST /api/building/place` may create ghost buildings on invalid spots. The `Place()` callback fires and creates an entity even when placement is invalid. Python-side validation blocks most cases, but multi-tile overlaps or bad terrain can still ghost.

    **Never test placement carelessly**. every failed `Place()` may create a ghost that needs manual cleanup.
