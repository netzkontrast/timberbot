## v0.9 In-mod MCP endpoint (`POST /mcp`)

The mod now hosts a stateless [MCP 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog) server on the existing HTTP port. No sidecar, no session handshake. See [MCP Endpoint](mcp.md).

- [feature] **`POST /mcp`** on the HTTP listener: `server/discover`, `tools/list` (deterministic order, `ttlMs`, `cacheScope`), `tools/call`. Required headers `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name` are validated against the body (`-32020` on mismatch); unsupported versions get `-32022` with the supported list; `initialize` gets `404`/`-32601`. `Origin` is validated (loopback or `corsOrigin`), `GET`/`DELETE` return `405`, notifications `202`.
- [feature] **14 `timberborn_*` tools** with strict input schemas and honest annotations: `get_summary`, `get_region`, `get_buildings`, `get_beavers`, `get_prefabs`, `find_placement`, `place_building`, `place_path`, `demolish`, `set_speed`, `set_workers`, `unlock_science`, `set_distribution`, `wait_frames`. Read tools run on the listener thread from snapshots; write tools go through the existing write-job queue.
- [feature] **Plain-text map** for `get_region` (`format=map`, default): about 1 token per cell instead of ~57 for the raw tiles JSON; no ANSI escapes. Raw JSON stays available (`format=json`, capped at 20×20).
- [feature] **MRTR confirmations** for `demolish` and `unlock_science`: elicitation-capable clients get an `input_required` result with an HMAC-signed, expiring `requestState`; other clients must pass `confirm: true`.
- [feature] **Structured errors on MCP**: game failures become tool errors with `{ok:false, code, reason, hint, at, details}` (`docs/spec/error-contract.md`). REST bodies are unchanged.
- [feature] `timberborn_get_prefabs` runs prefab enumeration on the game thread (queued job) instead of the listener thread.
- [fix] The HTTP-layer error writer (`TimberbotJw`) is now per-thread; it was one `StringBuilder` shared between the listener thread and the main thread.
- [settings] New `mcpEnabled` (default `true`).
- [internal] Protocol core `TimberbotMcp.cs`, error mapper `TimberbotErrors.cs` and map renderer `TimberbotMapText.cs` are Unity-free and covered by 39 new xUnit tests (455 total).

## v0.9 `tbot serve` waits for the mod by default

- [feature] **Launch-order-agnostic startup.** `tbot serve` no longer fails fast when the mod is unreachable at startup. It now retries the `/api/ping` probe with `exp_backoff(1s→30s)` — the same cadence `tbot watch` and `tbot listen` already use — until the game is reachable. Run `tbot serve` first, then start Timberborn; both orderings work.
- [feature] **`--no-wait` opt-out.** Scripts and CI that prefer the legacy fail-fast behaviour (clean exit if the mod is down) can pass `--no-wait`. The friendly `ModUnreachableError` handler in `cli.commands.serve` is unchanged.
- [behaviour] The first retry logs `serve: waiting for mod at http://… (launch Timberborn + load a save). Retrying every 1s…` at INFO so the operator can see what's happening; subsequent retries are at DEBUG to avoid log spam. Once the mod responds, `serve: mod reachable at …` is logged at INFO.

## v0.9 CLI: python-fire dispatcher

The `tbot` CLI is now dispatched via [python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) instead of the hand-rolled argparse + key:value dispatcher. The custom `cli/args.py` and `cli/dispatcher.py` modules are gone.

!!! warning "Breaking change for shell scripts and AI prompts"
    The legacy `tbot <command> key:value key:value` syntax no longer works. Pass arguments either positionally (in the order shown in `tbot <command> --help`) or with `--key=value` / `--key value` flags. Hyphens and underscores in flag names are interchangeable. Existing user-edited prompts under `~/.config/timberbot/agent_prompts/` need re-materializing (`tbot init --force`) or hand-updating.

- [feature] **python-fire dispatcher.** `tbot <method>` introspects every public `TimberbotClient` method and exposes it as a typed subcommand. Built-in subcommands (`top`, `manager`, `launch`, `init`, `listen`, `watch`, `serve`, `agent`) live as methods on the `Tbot` class; `agent` is a sub-group with `run` / `list_backends` / `prompts`.
- [feature] **Per-command `--help`.** `tbot <command> --help` renders the full Fire screen with positional args, flags, types, and defaults. `tbot --help` keeps a concise top-level index of builtins + client methods.
- [feature] **Hyphen↔underscore flag aliasing.** `--source_id=42` and `--source-id=42` both work for any flag.
- [removed] **`timberbot.cli.args` / `timberbot.cli.dispatcher`.** Scripts that imported `parse_flags`, `_build_registry`, `parse_kv_args`, `format_usage`, or `_inject_listen_globals` need updating; the same global flags (`--host=`, `--port=`, `--auth-token=`, `--json`, `-v`/`--debug`) are now parsed by `timberbot.cli.main.parse_global_flags`.

### Migration cheatsheet

## v0.9 WebSocket cutover

Hard cutover — no fallback path. The heartbeat-polling channel and the outbound-HTTP-webhook channel are both replaced by a single long-lived WebSocket.

!!! warning "Breaking change for existing `tbot watch`, `tbot listen`, and webhook subscribers"
    Old `tbot` versions stop working against a v0.9 WebSocket mod — they speak the deleted HTTP heartbeat. Reinstall the matching `tbot` version (`pipx install --upgrade timberbot`).

    Anyone hosting an HTTP server to receive `POST /api/webhooks` deliveries must migrate to either `tbot listen` or a custom WebSocket subscriber. There is no shim — the outbound HTTP delivery loop is gone.

- [feature] **WebSocket transport.** Parallel listener on `wsPort` (default 8086, `ws://host:wsPort/api/ws`). Frame envelope `{"type": "...", "payload": {...}}`. Server→client: `state`, `event`, `error`, `pong`. Client→server: `heartbeat`, `ping`. Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on the upgrade request (or `?token=` query param). Heartbeat cadence drops from 2 s polling to 30 s — WS ping/pong and TCP keepalive handle liveness.
- [feature] **`tbot listen` is now a pure WS client.** No more `--port` / `--host` inbound flags; `tbot listen` connects out to the mod and prints `event` frames as they arrive. `--pretty` and `--forward-to FILE|URL` still work.
- [feature] **`tbot watch` is now a pure WS client.** Polling loop and local-listener trigger queue deleted; the connector subscribes to the WS and reacts to `state` frames. `--listen-port` is gone — no inbound HTTP server.
- [feature] **WS protocol contract.** New `docs/websocket-protocol.md` is the authoritative wire spec. OpenAPI stays HTTP-only.
- [removed] **HTTP endpoints:** `POST /api/tbot/heartbeat`, `POST /api/tbot/register`, `POST /api/webhooks`, `GET /api/webhooks`, `POST /api/webhooks/delete`. The HTTP delivery loop, batching, circuit breaker, and subscriber registry in `TimberbotEvents.cs` are gutted (the `[OnEvent]` handlers stay; they now publish to the WS broadcaster).
- [removed] **Settings keys:** `webhooksEnabled`, `webhookBatchMs`, `webhookCircuitBreaker`, `webhookMaxPendingEvents`, `webhookValidateUrls`. Logged as ignored on load.
- [removed] **`tbotWebhookUrl` ephemeral field** and `ExpireWebhookIfStale()` from `TimberbotAgentState` / `TimberbotService` — no connector-trigger URL is ever stored.
- [removed] **Python client methods:** `TimberbotClient.tbot_heartbeat`, `tbot_register`, `set_webhook`, `delete_webhook`, `list_webhooks`. Generated pydantic models for those endpoints are deleted.
- [removed] **CLI commands:** `tbot register_webhook`, `tbot unregister_webhook`, `tbot list_webhooks`. Use `tbot listen` instead.
- [docs] [architecture.md](architecture.md), [getting-started.md](getting-started.md), and the renamed [events.md](events.md) (previously `webhooks.md`) rewritten around the WebSocket transport. `events.md` now documents WS event consumption rather than HTTP webhook registration. `AGENTS.md` (repo root) adds `docs/websocket-protocol.md` to the dev-facing read-first list.

### Migration cheatsheet

| You were doing | Do this instead |
|---|---|
| `tbot register_webhook url:... events:...` then hosting your own HTTP server | `tbot listen` (pure WS client; no port needed) |
| `tbot watch --listen-port 9000` | `tbot watch` (no `--listen-port` flag) |
| Custom HTTP receiver subscribed to events | Open a WS to `ws://host:8086/api/ws`, filter on `frame.payload.event` |
| Bumping `webhookBatchMs` to reduce delivery rate | Buffer client-side — the mod pushes one frame per event |
| Relying on circuit-breaker auto-disable | Reconnect on your own; the mod drops slow consumers from the bounded send queue |

## v0.9 architecture cutover (connector model)

Hard cutover — no fallback path. The widget no longer spawns the agent; the connector does.

- [feature] **`tbot watch` connector.** Long-running Python process: reconnects with exponential backoff, heartbeats every 30 s over the WebSocket, dispatches `tbot agent run` (or attaches to `opencode serve`) per cycle.
- [feature] **Launch / Stop ready gate.** The widget button replaces Start/Stop. Until the player presses Launch, the mod returns `409 game_not_ready` on **every `/api/*` read and write** except `/api/agent/*`, `/api/ready`, `/api/ping`. Game events keep flowing over the WebSocket.
- [feature] **Mode dropdown.** Request (default) vs Autonomous. Request mode has a per-launch prompt textarea; autonomous mode persists `goal` to `state.json` and lets the connector pick cadence.
- [feature] **Four new endpoints.** `GET /api/agent/state`, `POST /api/agent/config`, `POST /api/agent/request`, `POST /api/ready`. (`POST /api/tbot/register` and `POST /api/tbot/heartbeat` were added here and later removed in the WS cutover above.)
- [feature] **Bearer-token auth.** `authToken` in `settings.json` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/api/*` route (constant-time compare). The mod refuses to start with a non-localhost `listenAddress` and empty `authToken`. Client side adds `[client].auth_token`, `TBOT_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TimberbotClient(auth_token=…)`.
- [feature] **`tbot listen` WS client.** Pure WebSocket subscriber that connects to the mod and prints `event` frames; `--pretty` for human rendering, `--forward-to FILE|URL` for piping.
- [feature] **opencode `--attach`.** `[backends.opencode].attach_url` (or `--attach-url`) makes `tbot agent run` target a long-running `opencode serve` instead of spawning a fresh process.
- [feature] **`state.json`.** New file alongside `settings.json` for agent-shaped state. Persists `mode`, `goal`, `lastError`. Ephemeral state (`ready`, `pendingRequest`, `tbotWebhookUrl`, `lastAckedRequestId`) resets on save load. (`tbotWebhookUrl` is later removed in the WS cutover entry above; no replacement field — there's no connector-trigger URL to store.)
- [removed] `TimberbotAgent` subprocess spawn. The mod is a pure HTTP server.
- [removed] Settings keys: `agentBinary`, `agentGoal`, `agentModel`, `agentEffort`, `agentCommandTemplate`, `agentAllowlistEnabled`, `agentAllowedBinaries`, `tbotCommand`. Backend choice lives in `~/.config/timberbot/config.toml`; the connector runs `tbot`, not the mod.
- [docs] [getting-started.md](getting-started.md), [timberbot.md](timberbot.md), `webhooks.md` (later renamed to [events.md](events.md) in the WS cutover), and [architecture.md](architecture.md) rewritten around the new flow.

## Error messages

Every API error response is now rich and actionable. The AI gets enough context to correct the next call without guessing.

**Write endpoints (TimberbotWrite.cs)**
- [fix] `not_found` errors explain that ids are ephemeral and tell the caller to re-query buildings
- [fix] `invalid_type` errors include the building name and explain which building types support the operation
- [fix] `invalid_param` errors echo the bad value and list all valid options
- [fix] `no_population` includes requested vs available count
- [fix] `insufficient_science` includes cost and current points with a human-readable message
- [fix] district errors (`not_found`, `SetDistribution`) list all available district names
- [fix] recipe and plantable errors list all available options for that building

**Placement (TimberbotPlacement.cs)**
- [fix] placement validation errors name the blocking object (e.g. "occupied by Lumberjack") instead of generic "occupied"
- [fix] every validation error includes a suggestion (e.g. "demolish it or try a different location")
- [fix] `not_unlocked` tells the caller to use science/unlock first
- [internal] extracted `FindBlockerAt()` helper for DRY blocker lookup across buildings, natural resources, and tracked blockers

**HTTP server (TimberbotHttpServer.cs)**
- [fix] `invalid_body` explains the expected format
- [fix] `unknown_endpoint` now lists all GET and POST endpoints (was only 13, now 55+)

**Python client (timberbot.py)**
- [fix] unknown CLI parameters now show the bad param, valid params, and full usage line
- [fix] toon error output shows the full response dict instead of just the error string

## Storage

- [feature] `POST /api/building/storage` endpoint for piles, warehouses, and tanks
- [feature] set allowed good (`good:Water`) and storage mode (`mode:obtain`) in one call
- [feature] four storage modes matching the player UI: accept, obtain, supply, empty
- [feature] `storageMode` and `allowedGood` fields in buildings detail:full output
- [fix] `SingleGoodAllower` now uses `Allow()` / `Disallow()` instead of direct property set, so the UI updates correctly
- [breaking] `/api/stockpile/good` and `/api/stockpile/capacity` removed, replaced by `/api/building/storage`

## Write endpoint fixes

- [fix] `Workplace.SetDesiredWorkers()` used instead of direct property set, fires `DesiredWorkersChanged` event and handles overstaffing
- [fix] `WorkingHoursManager.WorkedPartOfDay` used instead of direct `EndHours` set, fires `WorkingHoursChangedEvent`
- [fix] `set_workers` minimum clamped to 1 (was 0), matching player UI behavior
- [breaking] `set_capacity` removed, player cannot change stockpile capacity

## Agent

- [removed] shipped Claude Code hooks (`pretool-bash.py`, `session-start.py`) deleted. they blocked parallel tool calls and are no longer needed

## Panel defaults

- [fix] model and effort defaults extracted to named constants (`DefaultClaudeModel`, `DefaultCodexModel`, etc.) instead of scattered string literals
- [fix] switching binary (claude/codex) auto-selects the correct default model and effort

## Testing

- [new] 141 xUnit unit tests for `TimberbotJw` (serialization, commas, nesting, reuse) and `TimberbotPure` (orientation, name cleanup, assertions, normalization, quoting)
- [new] `timberbot/test/` project (net8.0, xUnit) shares source files with the main project, no Unity deps required
- [internal] extracted pure static helpers from 5 Unity-dependent files into `TimberbotPure.cs`

## Docs

- [docs] "Timberbot AI" pages renamed to "Timberbot Guide"
- [docs] getting-started page updated with setup instructions
