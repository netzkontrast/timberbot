# Timberbot

Play Timberborn through `tbot`.

ALWAYS use local docs when available.
NEVER switch to GitHub docs without user approval.

1. Check `docs/timberbot.md` in the current working directory.
2. Otherwise check `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Timberborn\Mods\Timberbot\docs\` — the mod deploys its docs there.
3. If neither exists, ask the user if it is okay to use the GitHub docs at `https://github.com/netzkontrast/timberbot/tree/main/docs`. Do NOT fall back to `abix-/TimberbornMods` — that is the upstream this project forked from, and its docs predate the WebSocket stream, the MCP endpoint, and the automation wiring API. Following them will make you call endpoints that do not exist.

ALWAYS use `tbot` directly.
NEVER infer repo paths from Workshop paths or Workshop paths from repo paths.

- Install: `pipx install timberbot` provides the `tbot` console script (import path is `timberbot`)
- `tbot` talks to the mod purely over HTTP/WS; nothing under the game's `Documents/Timberborn/` tree is read or written. If the mod runs on another host, set `TBOT_HOST=<host>` or pass `--host=<host>`.

ALWAYS read `docs/timberbot.md` first.
NEVER read another doc before the AI guide.

ALWAYS use `docs/api-reference.md` for exact commands, parameters, responses, helpers, and errors.
NEVER improvise API contract details.

ALWAYS use `docs/getting-started.md` for install, PATH, remote host, Workshop path, and troubleshooting.
NEVER treat setup docs as gameplay docs.

ALWAYS run the boot/link flow once at session start, and only run it again if the user explicitly wants to restart or clear memory.
NEVER act before boot completes or repeat boot just because the task changed.

ALWAYS run mutating game actions sequentially.
NEVER overlap mutating game API calls.

ALWAYS prefer `brain`, `find_placement`, and `find_planting`.
NEVER guess state, coordinates, faction prefabs, or irrigated tiles.

ALWAYS re-read state after each mutation batch.
NEVER trust pre-mutation observations after state changes.

ALWAYS confine actions to what the user asked for. Mention out-of-scope problems and ask before fixing them.
NEVER take initiative on side issues (unpause, demolish, "fix" alerts) without confirmation.

ALWAYS produce a visible todo list AND WAIT for explicit user approval before executing any plan with more than 2 mutating steps. Print the list and say "Waiting for approval…" then STOP.
NEVER self-approve a mutation plan. The user must say "proceed", "go", "do it", or similar before you execute.

ALWAYS prefer TOON format (default) over `--json` for reading game state. TOON is ~3–5× more token-efficient. Use `--json` only when you need to pipe output to a script or parse nested structure programmatically.
NEVER dump `--json` output of large endpoints (buildings, beavers, power) directly into context. If you must use JSON, pipe through `tq` to extract only the fields you need.

ALWAYS use `tbot` CLI parameters as shown in `tbot <command> --help`. `tbot` is dispatched via python-fire, so flags are spelled `--key=value` (or `--key value`); positional args are also accepted in the order shown in `--help`. List endpoints (`buildings`, `beavers`, `trees`, `crops`, `gatherables`) support server-side filtering:
- `--name=X` — case-insensitive substring match (e.g. `tbot buildings --name=Pump`)
- `--x=N --y=N --radius=N` — proximity filter by Manhattan distance (REQUIRES BOTH `--x` AND `--y`)
- `--id=N` — select a single entity
- `--detail=full` — include all fields (inventory, needs, automation)

NEVER use `2>&1` when piping CLI output to parsers like `tq` — CLI errors on stderr will corrupt the data stream and cause parse failures. Standard pipes (`|`) naturally separate stdout (data) from stderr (errors), allowing you to read errors without corrupting the pipe.

ALWAYS treat entity IDs as persistent across game reloads. Cache them in `brain.toon` locations with `tbot set_location --name=<name> --x=<x> --y=<y> --z=<z> --note="id:<entity_id> role:<role>"` and read them back via `tbot list_locations`.
NEVER re-discover an ID you have already cached this session unless a mutation invalidated it.

ALWAYS read `buildings[].automation` to discover current wiring. Each transmitter has `automation.outputs`; each automatable building has `automation.input`.
NEVER call `unlink` to probe what's connected. Unlink is destructive and has no undo.

## Three orthogonal systems (do not mix vocabularies)

Timberborn reuses words like "high" and "low" across three unrelated systems. Mixing their vocabularies causes hallucinated commands. See `design/automation-states.md` for the full breakdown.

| System | Values | Endpoint shape |
|---|---|---|
| **Automation signals** | `On` / `Off` (boolean) | `link` / `unlink` / `configure_automation --property=threshold --value=0.5` |
| **Priorities** (worker allocation only) | `VeryLow` / `Low` / `Normal` / `High` / `VeryHigh` | `set_priority --priority=High` |
| **Physical states** | floats (`0.5`, `1.0`) or specific enums (`accept`, `obtain`, `supply`, `empty`) | `set_floodgate --height=0.5`, `set_storage --mode=obtain` |

ALWAYS use `On`/`Off` for automation logic.
NEVER set an automation wire to `High`/`Low` — those words don't exist in this system.

ALWAYS use exact floats for floodgate heights and sensor thresholds (`height:0.5`, `threshold:0.85`).
NEVER write `set_floodgate --height=Low` or `set_floodgate --height=High` — heights are floats.

ALWAYS use `VeryLow`..`VeryHigh` only for `set_priority`. Priorities affect worker allocation; they do not activate machines or change physical states.
NEVER try to "activate" a building or change its mode via priority. Priority controls who gets staffed first, nothing else.

ALWAYS remember that a sensor's reading is analog (e.g. depth `0.5`) but its wire output is strictly `On` or `Off` based on its `threshold` and `mode`.
NEVER treat a sensor's wire output as analog.

## Automation signal cheat sheet (memorize, do not re-derive)

The signal means "permission to run".

- Automatable input `On`           → building **RUNS** normally (signal grants permission)
- Automatable input `Off`          → building **PAUSED** by automation
- Automatable input *Disconnected* → building **RUNS** normally (no signal at all is not the same as `Off`)
- Lever pinned active   → output `On`
- Lever pinned inactive → output `Off`
- Relay mode `Not`      → output = NOT(inputA)

Recipes:
- "X active when lever is on"  → wire lever → X (direct). Lever on → X gets `On` → X runs.
- "X active when lever is off" → wire lever → NOT relay → X. Lever off → relay outputs `On` → X runs.
- "X and Y switch modes"       → one direct, the other through a NOT relay.

ALWAYS delegate wiring changes to the `wirer` subagent. If your reasoning about signals or wiring exceeds three paragraphs, STOP and delegate.
NEVER derive signal logic in your own thinking. You will get it wrong.

ALWAYS delegate to `auditor` when you need to inspect more than 5 buildings, analyze wellbeing across the colony, check automation state, or summarize alerts. The auditor returns a tight filtered slice.
NEVER manually loop through building queries yourself — if you're about to run 3+ read calls, delegate to `auditor` instead.

ALWAYS check `design/automation-plan.md` when working on automation features (sensors, relays, wiring, levers, timers, etc.). The plan doc has the decompiled API surface and exact implementation details for `link`, `unlink`, and `configure_automation` endpoints. If the plan doc describes a feature not yet in `docs/api-reference.md`, flag it to the user before implementing.

ALWAYS check `design/automation-states.md` if you find yourself unsure whether a value is `On`/`Off`, a priority, or a float. That doc disambiguates the three systems with examples of each pitfall.

ALWAYS use `tbot summary` or `tbot brain` for power overview (supply vs demand). 
NEVER dump the full `tbot power` endpoint into context — it lists every PowerShaft entity and can exceed 400 lines. Only query specific buildings by ID when you need wiring details.

## Goal interpretation

Goals are **directions**, not **authorizations**.

- `survive` means: ensure beavers don't die (food, water, shelter). It does NOT authorize changing production, unpausing buildings, or reorganizing the colony.
- `thrive` means: improve wellbeing and growth. Still requires user confirmation for major changes.
- `build X` means: place the specific thing asked for. Nothing else.
- Any goal: if the colony is stable and the goal is met, report status and WAIT for the user to give specific tasks.

When in doubt about scope, ASK. The default is to do nothing rather than do something unauthorized.

## Concrete prohibition: do NOT unpause buildings

Manually-paused buildings (alert type "Пауза.") were paused by the human player for a reason.
NEVER unpause them without explicit user approval for EACH building or group.
Present the list of paused buildings with names and counts, then ASK before changing their state.

Automation-paused buildings ("Пауза через автоматизацію") are controlled by the wiring system.
NEVER manually unpause an automation-paused building — the automation will immediately re-pause it.
To change automation behavior, investigate the wiring first (delegate to `auditor`), then modify the automation graph (delegate to `wirer`), not the building's pause state.

## Subagents

- `wirer` — Applies automation graph changes. Give it a target wiring table.
- `scout` — Validates building placement. Give it a prefab and rough area.
- `auditor` — Read-only state inspection. Give it a focused question; it returns a filtered slice. **Use it** whenever you need to inspect >5 buildings, survey alerts, or trace automation wiring.

How you reach them depends on your harness. Under `tbot agent run` / `tbot watch` you delegate with your host's task tool, naming the subagent. Under `tbot serve` the game MCP server exposes an explicit delegation surface instead — `delegate` to start one, then `subagent_status` / `subagent_wait` / `subagent_reply` to drive it, `subagent_list` and `subagent_transcript` to inspect, `subagent_close` when done. If you do not see those tools, you are not on that path; use your host's task tool.
